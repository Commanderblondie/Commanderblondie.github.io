<h2>UniBoxes</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game? <li><font color="red">The duality of abilities the two squares have.</font></li>
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?<li><font color="red">The squares move each other if they are connected.</font></li>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?<li><font color="red">I learned how interesting co-op games can be. The easiest thing to do was make the images, while the hardest was trying to create situations for their unique abilities to shine.</font></li>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here. <li><font color="red">I made this from scratch.</font></li>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here. <li><font color="red">I think my game mostly resembles Portal.</font></li>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game. <li><font color="red">Use your squares unique abilities to work together and solve the puzzles.</font></li>
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used. <li><font color="red">Co-op.</font></li>
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype. <li><font color="red">Input: WASD, the Arrow Keys, and R. The down arrow and S stop X axis movement to allow for more precise jumps. R resets the squares. Randomness: None. Genre: Platformer. Play Style: Co-op.</font></li>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating? <li><font color="red">The mechanics evaluated are the co-op between two people with unique abilities.</font></li>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game? <li><font color="red">I want players to enjoy figuring out how to use their squares movement differences to solve puzzles.</font></li>
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototype’s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype. <li><font color="red">Both players can move and jump. R resets them. The blue square can double jump while orange square moves faster. Players are meant to use these abilities in tandem to solve puzzles. The system is a local multiplayer. The core mechanic is the interaction between the squares abilities.</font></li>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game? <li><font color="red">Cooperation.</font></li>
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension? <li><font color="red">The game is meant to be a prison break, but would require more fleshed out intro and ending scenes/backgrounds.</font></li>
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.<li><font color="red">People who enjoy puzzle platformers.</font></li>
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play? <li><font color="red">Between 5-10 minutes.</font></li>
</li>
