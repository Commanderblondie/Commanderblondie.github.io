<h2>Your game title</h2>

<ul>
<a href="C:\Users\Tyler\Documents\CS 325\Templates\template-minimal - Digital1">My Folder</a>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game? 
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology? <li><font color="red">It randomizes where the platforms fall from.</font></li>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype? 
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it? <li><font color="red">I learned how to use Phaser. The easiest part was making the player move, and the hardest part was adding physics.</font></li>


<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here. <li><font color="red">I made everything from scratch.</font></li>
<ul>

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.<li><font color="red">A game my game resembles is the app game Doodle Jump</font></li>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.<li><font color="red">Survive the falling blocks by jumping.</font></li>
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.<li><font color="red">Survival.</font></li>
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.<li><font color="red">Input: Arrow Keys. Randomness: Blocks. Genre: Survival. Play Style: Generic.</font></li>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?<li><font color="red">The game mechanic evaluated is the jumping from one falling block to another.</font></li>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?<li><font color="red">I want players to be focused and have a difficult time surviving.</font></li>
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototype’s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.<li><font color="red">The player can use all the arrow keys to move in those directions, even down. The effects of these are simple movement and jumping. The falling blocks fall faster as they go due to gravity, and cannot be jumped through. The player must skillfully jump from one platform to the next without hitting the bottom of a platform or falling out of the area.</font></li>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?<li><font color="red">I expect players will use the down arrow to land faster and attempt difficult jumps to get higher and safer.</font></li>
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?<li><font color="red">The game is abstract.</font></li>
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.<li><font color="red">Players looking for a challenge.</font></li>
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?<li><font color="red">Depending on skill, I estimate a game could take from 30 seconds to a few minutes.</font></li>
</li>
